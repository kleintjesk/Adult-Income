# The Influence of Marital Status and Age on Income
## Kailin Kleintjes

An individual’s annual income results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc.

## Objective
Is marital status or age a good indicator of income? How will this impact marketing for a product?

## *Data source:* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset

## *Analysis*
In this data set we are trying to predict whether a person will make over 50k or under / equal to 50K.

The first visualization shows which income is obtained based on marital status. We can see that a majority of the participants fall in the under / equal to 50k income range. We can also see a significant difference between the category “married civilian spouse" and all other marital categories as it has the highest number of participants making over 50k.

The two largest groups and most common marital status is “never married” or “married civilian spouse”. We can see that 20-year-olds most frequently fall in the never married  category, which is also the category with most participants falling in the under / equal to 50K category. 

Next in highest number for never married are 30 year olds who  are split almost evenly between “never married” and “married civilian spouse”.

 40-year-olds make up the highest category in “married civilian spouse”, Which is also the category that had the most participants making over 50K. However 40-year-olds also have a much lower, but still significant, number  of participants in “never married” and “divorced”. These categories have a number of participants almost equal to each other..

What does this tell us about predicting income? Based on these two visualizations if we know a participant's marital status and age we can better predict which income class they fall in. For example a 20 year old who has never been married is most likely to fall in the under/equal to 50K range. However, if we have a 40-year-old who married a civilian spouse we can predict that they are most likely in the over 50k range.

## *Recommendations*

Based on the information it is recomended that the product have a luxury and an economic version. Ales for the higher priced luxury item should be marketed towards older married idividuals as they typically have the higher income. On the other hand, a product that is more budgetfriendly would most like provide for better sales in the younger individual with a lower income.
